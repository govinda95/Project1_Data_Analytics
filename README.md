Here in this repository Python machine learning file,Sql, tableau, powerbi and excel file is uploaded.
Data is related to a shopping store having data related to customer spending and pattern of spending.
I have worked on machine learning to divide the customers into different clusters based ML algorithms like Kmeans and Agglomerative clustering.
from Agglomerative clustering Profiling is also performed to extract meaning insights about the different clusters customers and their impact on buisness
2 Dashboard are generated one using sql commands and transffered their output to Powebi to generate meaningful insights from sql Queries
Tableau used to generate some trend insights and how customers spended amount based on product, quarter and month.
Excel i used to generate conditional formatting table which shows features and their behaviour in different clusters of customer.
there are lots of project i have worked on but this proeject helps me to understand a lot about buisness insights and analysis of Data.
